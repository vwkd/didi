## What?

- language for string matching



## Differences to RegEx

- code defines behavior, no flags/modifiers on outside
  - code for repeated matches
  - code for amount of repeated matches, not just one or any
  - code for case insensitivity
  - code for multiple lines
  - etc.
- single match by default, not multiple
- start to end by default, not anywhere
- grouping is distinct from matching
- no escaping necessary (except quotes)
- reads like programming language
- variables for code reuse



## Principles

- be readable
- be functional since no (explicit) input and output
