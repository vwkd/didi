# Introduction



## What?

- language for string matching



## Principles

- be readable
- be functional since no (explicit) input and output



## Advantages

- language is by default code instead of string matching, needs to opt-in instead of opt-out
- strings are strings, no escaping
- symbols only used for control flow, not for string matching
- matching is not default
- code defines entire behavior, no flags/modifiers outside of code like in regex
- variables for code reuse
- modules for code reuse
- looks nicer over multiple lines
