# Introduction



## What?

- language for string matching



## Principles

- be readable
- be functional since no (explicit) input and output



## Advantages

- language is by default code instead of string matching, needs to opt-in instead of opt-out
- doesn't match by default, needs to opt-in instead of opt-out
- no escaping necessary (except quotes)
- amount of repeated matches between one and any don't need manual repetition
- code defines entire behavior, no flags/modifiers on outside, e.g. amount of repeated matches, multiple lines, case insensitivity, etc.
- variables for code reuse
- modules for code reuse
- nicer syntax, more like programming language
- grouping doesn't also match
