# Didi

A language for string matching.

It strives to be more like a programming language. Didi means "little brother" in Chinese.



## What?

Currently it's nothing more than a loose specification and a few examples. An implementation can be considered only when the spec really makes sense.



## Why?

Regular Expressions are well known for being hard to read. It might look fine for your simple day-to-day stuff, but if you're doing any serious matching the fun is over. Code should be easy to read by humans. Regular Expressions aren't.
  
One day when reading a RegEx with an alternate `a|b` it reminded me of if..else logic in programming languages. I wondered why RegEx are so hard to read while programming languages aren't. I thought about it a bit. I laid fruits out on the table to visualize code paths. Then I iterated a bit on syntax until I found something that I liked. Thinking about it more as a programming language, many concepts suddenly made much more sense, like variables, modules or comments. One can really feel that string matching language haven't seen much thought put into them as they are only a little brother to the programming languages.
