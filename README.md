# Didi

A language for string matching.

It strives to be more like a programming language. Didi means "little brother" in Chinese.



## What?

Currently it's nothing more than a loose specification and a few examples. An implementation can be considered only when the spec really makes sense.



## Why?

Regular Expressions are well known for being hard to read. It might look great for replacing "a" with "b", but as soon as you do more complicated stuff the fun is over. Code should be easy to read by humans. Regular Expressions aren't.
  
One day when reading a RegEx the alternate `a|b` reminded me of a if..else in a programming language. I wondered why RegEx weren't so easy to read like a programming language. I played around with some syntax from programming languages until a minimal set made some sense. From thinking about it more as a programming language, many concepts like variables, modules or comments followed over.
