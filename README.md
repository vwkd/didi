# Didi

A programming language for string matching.

Didi means "little brother" in Chinese. A string matching language is a little brother to a programming language.



## What?

Regular Expressions are well known for being hard to read. Code should be designed to be easy to read by the human, not necessarily by machine. Regular Expressions aren't.
  
One day, when reading some RegEx `a|b` it reminded me of a code path in a programming language. Either take this route or that route. I asked myself if there wasn't a way to make string matching easier to read.

Quite naturally many things followed from thinking about it like a programming language. Reusable bits in the form of functions. Importing foreign bits using modules.
